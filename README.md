# Chronic Kidney Disease
The goal of this project is to use computer vision and machine learning techiniques to automatically detect the presence of CKD (chronic kidney disease) through scintigraphic images. It tries to reproduce and improve on the experiments decribed in this [work](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/sibgrapi_estendido/article/view/8318).

It also has a folder with the generated images and for the written report detailing and justifying all the experiments.
